# Ding Dong - Nostr web client in Haskell

Try it here (https://github.com/dingydongy). I have ever only run it on Firefox, so have no idea how it behaves in other browsers.

I started this project mostly to flex my Haskell muscle. Looking for something to build, I came across the idea of social media based on simple exchange of messages, signed by user's private key - Nostr. 

After spending some time on Twitter I often felt frustrated that my "feed" is constructed by somebody else, or that some people can just forbid you 
to comment on their posts, or that your account can be closed arbitarily (did not happen to me).

These problems either don't exist or can be solved using Nostr protocol.

I also missed features. One of them being notified when someone from some list of users comments on some thread for example. 
Another example would be to find other accounts, by let's say how many endorsments they received from your list of trusted/favourite users. Or how to automatically mute accounts which your list of trusted users mute etc etc...

With Nostr, you can implement whatever feature you would like traditional social media to have. 

There are many, more mature Nostr clients out there. Unfortunately they made the fatal mistake of being built using some popular languages and so will inevitably perish in the complexity they will not be able to manage, while Haskell will rule the galaxyðŸ¤žðŸ˜Ž

# General
* The crypto part has not gone through any review, let alone audit. It's fine for playing, but just to be safe, assume the generated keys to be weak and leak easily.
* Many thanks to [terrorJack](https://github.com/TerrorJack/) and [amesgen](https://github.com/amesgen) and the rest of #haskell-wasm and #haskell channels for advice/troubleshooting.
* Parts of this project (mostly data records and their *JSON instances) are taken from [prolic](https://github.com/prolic/)'s Futr project.
* Contribute! If you have a question, open an issue on github.

# Current state

* None of the lofty features I touched upon in the introduction are implemented yet. Still trying to reach feature parity with mature Nostr clients.

* Click on stuff and see what happens, that's the userguide.

* I have made some default "following", by choosing some popular accounts as well as some other accounts I run across by chance. That does not mean I endorse any of their posts.

* The feed is only displaying original posts and replies from the people you follow (i.e. you will not see content from people you are not following, unless some of the people you follow replies to such content).

# Architecture
* Haskell compiled to WebAssembly. Using Miso as a frontend library
* To get a better idea about how this combo works, first take a look at a more didactic example here https://github.com/tweag/ghc-wasm-miso-examples 
* WIP actual architecture of ding-dong

# Building
* start nix shell with haskell WASM buildtools 
    * I am using this one (thanks [terrorJack](https://github.com/TerrorJack/))
         https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/wasm-th-tmp/ghc-wasm-meta-wasm-th-tmp.tar.gz 
   
    * fire it up by running 
     ```
     nix shell https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc-wasm-meta/-/archive/wasm-th-tmp/ghc-wasm-meta-wasm-th-tmp.tar.gz      --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
     ```
 All the next steps assume you are inside the above shell
* you need to build libsecp256k1 C library for WASM platform first
    * download or clone from here https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/
    * configure and install  (change  `some-directory` to where you want to library to land after make install)
     ```
     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure --prefix=some_directory CC=wasm32-wasi-clang --host=wasm32-unknown-wasi --enable-module-schnorrsig  CPPFLAGS=-D__OpenBSD__ CFLAGS="$CONF_CC_OPTS_STAGE2"
     ./make
     ./make install
     ```
* open ding-dong.cabal and change `extra-lib-dirs:` to `some_directory` (or wherever you installed libsecp256k1 to)
* go to `frontend` directory and do 
    * ```./build.sh && pushd dist; NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1 nix-shell -p python --run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'; popd```
         * this will build and deploy to localhost:8000
* Note: I have only tested it on Firefox
